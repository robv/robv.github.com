title: A Fresh Start
excerpt:
  It was about time for a reboot, so I threw the old site out &amp; started from scratch. Hopefully the new format will motivate me to be a more active "blogger".

Ok, so I've never actively maintained a personal website, after every refresh I'll post a few entries over the course of a few months &amp; then just forget about the space. Here's to that not happening this time around.

For those interested, I'll briefly go over my current setup. I've abandoned Wordpress in favor of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Wordpress made the process of blogging feel stale &amp; painful, &amp; maintaining it was just no fun. The move to Jekyll was a fairly obvious one to make, it provides a substantial amount of flexibility &amp; thus far, it just feels right. Because the website is now driven by Jekyll &amp; because [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) makes serving such a site effortless, I've decided that for now, it'll do.

There's nothing left to say except that, I hope to regularly post to this website &amp; I hope that soon enough people will find that useful.
